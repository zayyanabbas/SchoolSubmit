## Installation

<br>

### *Mac & Linux*
Haven't made binaries for Mac yet, please refer to manual installation

<br>

### *Manual installation*
Download the source code. You'll need the following dependencies:

- pandas
- tkinter
- numpy
- urllib

Please contact me, because some of the code has been changed to protect privacy. Check out Usage, but instead of `csv_maker`, run `create_spreadsheet.py` and instead of `form_completer.exe`, run `google_forms.py`. 

<br>

## Usage

<br>

1. First run `csv_maker`, use it to fill in your name, email, section and routine. You fill in your routine by using the dropdown boxes for the, day and then filling the classes.
2. An `info.csv` file is made. This file contains your information.
3. Every time you want to submit your attendance, run `form_completer`. It will open up a console window, showing you the status of the submissions.
